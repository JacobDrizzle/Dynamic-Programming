# Dynamic Programming

Welcome to the **Dynamic Programming** repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of various dynamic programming problems and their solutions. Dynamic programming is a method for efficiently solving a broad range of search and optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. The solutions in this repository demonstrate how dynamic programming can be applied to optimize algorithms that might otherwise have exponential time complexity.

## Repository Overview

In this repository, you'll find Java code examples that tackle different classic dynamic programming challenges, including but not limited to:

- Calculating Fibonacci numbers efficiently.
- Finding the minimum number of coins for change-making problems.
- Counting paths in a grid with obstacles.
- Determining the maximum sum path in a grid.
- Maximizing the sum of non-adjacent numbers in a list.
- Minimizing the number of perfect squares that sum up to a given number.

Each code example is accompanied by detailed comments, explaining the logic behind the implementation and the dynamic programming techniques used. This makes the repository an excellent resource for both learning and reference.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Algorithms**: Demonstrates how dynamic programming turns exponential-time algorithms into polynomial-time.
- **Memoization**: Each solution utilizes memoization to enhance performance by storing and reusing previously computed results.
- **Clear Explanations**: Comprehensive comments in the code explain each step, making the algorithms accessible to beginners and seasoned programmers alike.
- **Diverse Problems**: A range of problems showcasing the versatility of dynamic programming in problem-solving.
